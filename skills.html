        <h1>My Skills and what I bring to the table</h1>

        <br />

        <p>
          With around 3 years of experience as an ETL developer, I bring a solid
          foundation in data engineering and backend workflows. I’ve worked
          extensively with SQL, AWS services, and Informatica pipelines to
          design, build, and optimize data systems. My work required a strong
          focus on efficiency, problem-solving, and ensuring the seamless flow
          of information—skills I believe are equally valuable in HCI projects.
          While I come from a backend-heavy background, I’m excited to apply my
          analytical mindset and technical expertise to HCI challenges.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I’m a team player who thrives in collaborative environments and enjoys
          brainstorming and building solutions that make an impact. My ability
          to understand complex systems, communicate effectively, and contribute
          to team goals will make me a reliable and resourceful teammate for
          group projects in this class.
