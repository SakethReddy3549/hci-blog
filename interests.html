          Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) fascinates me because of its critical
          role in bridging the gap between people and technology. I am
          particularly interested in designing intuitive, user-friendly
          interfaces that enhance accessibility and make technology more
          inclusive.

          Through this course, I aim to deepen my understanding of user-centered
          design principles, usability testing, and interactive interface
          design. I look forward to applying these concepts to real-world
          problems, improving my ability to create impactful digital
          experiences.
