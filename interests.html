          Human-Computer Interaction is fascinating because it sits at the
          crossroads of technology and human behavior. As someone with a
          background in working behind the scenes on data—managing databases,
          optimizing workflows, and integrating complex pipelines—I’ve always
          been curious about the why behind user needs. How do we make systems
          not just functional but truly intuitive? Through this class, I want to
          broaden my understanding of designing systems that serve users
          effectively, whether they’re navigating an interface, processing large
          datasets, or analyzing results. I’m particularly interested in
          learning how HCI principles can improve interactions for
          data-intensive platforms, ensuring usability and efficiency for those
          working with massive datasets.
