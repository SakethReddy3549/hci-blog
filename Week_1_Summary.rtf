\f0\fs26 \cf0 Human-computer interaction (HCI) developed as computers got easier to use. In the 1940s, only scientists used huge, complicated machines. By the 1980s, computers became simpler, which made HCI important. Key moments were Vannevar Bush\'92s 1945 idea for future information tools, Ivan Sutherland\'92s Sketchpad (1962), and the computer mouse (1963). The Xerox Star computer (1981) added graphical screens, and HCI officially started in 1983 with the first ACM SIGCHI conference. The Apple Macintosh (1984) made HCI even better, helping computers feel more interactive and creating the tech we use today.}
